This is a sample website for a fictional salon called Radiant Locks. The website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the Tailwind CSS framework. It also uses the Google Calendar API to allow users to book appointments.

Installation
To run the website locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Alternatively, you can use a local development server to run the website. For example, you can use the live-server package in Node.js:

Install Node.js on your machine.
Install the live-server package using npm: npm install -g live-server
Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal.
Run the live-server command: live-server
The website should now be running at http://localhost:8080.

Usage
The website consists of several pages, including a home page, services page, contact page, and about us page. Users can book appointments using the Book Now button on the services page, which will take them to a Google Calendar page where they can select an available time slot.
